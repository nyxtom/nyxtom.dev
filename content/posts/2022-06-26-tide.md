---

Up until now, it was relatively difficult to implement async web servers in [rust-lang](https://rust-lang.org) due to the constraints with the language. Now that async/await is part of the standard library (in terms of syntax and compilation) we can take advantage of async runtimes and popular web frameworks to build our very own blog in Rust! 

To do this we will take advantage of an async runtime known as [async-std](https://docs.rs/async-std/) as well as a minimal web framework [http-rs/tide](https://github.com/http-rs/tide). 

We will also use [pulldown-cmark](https://docs.rs/pulldown-cmark) to support the [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/) markdown specification and [handlebars](https://docs.rs/handlebars) for templating. 

Let's get started.

## Dependencies

First you'll need to setup a new project with a few dependencies by running **cargo init**. Then add the following dependencies to your **Cargo.toml** file.

```toml
[package]
name = "notes"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[dependencies]
async-std = { version = "1.12.0", features = ["attributes"] }
handlebars = "4.3.1"
pulldown-cmark = "0.9.1"
serde = { version = "1.0.137", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "1.0.81"
tide = "0.16.0"
```

## async primitives with [async-std](https://docs.rs/async-std) 

We'll use [async-std](https://docs.rs/async-std) to manage the async runtime for us. All async/await code gets transformed into code that simply returns a [Future](https://docs.rs/std/future/trait.Future.html) trait. It's a bit more than that as the compiler will use generators to do this, but ultimately the result is still a Future.

Because [futures](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/future/trait.Future.html) are lazy by default, an executor (or runtime) needs to actually [poll](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/future/trait.Future.html#the-poll-method) in order to advance each future in the executor's task queue. A runtime typically includes a task queue, an executor that manages those tasks, and an underlying reactor to react to underlying OS specific event notifications and non-blocking apis (e.g. [mio](https://docs.rs/mio) or [polling](https://docs.rs/polling)). The polling api will typically abstract over either readiness based models (e.g. [epoll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoll), [kqueue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kqueue), [poll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poll_(Unix))) or completion based models (e.g. [iocp](https://github.com/tokio-rs/mio/blob/fc2080cd0a663125b59f0afa2bc1c771a3fbec1e/src/sys/windows/named_pipe.rs#L37), [io_uring](https://github.com/tokio-rs/mio/issues/923)). 

> For an in depth look at async I/O, runtimes and system call apis like the ones listed above take a look at a series I cover here on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLb1VOxJqFzDd05_aDQEm6KVblhee_KStX).

```rust
use async_std::net::TcpListener;
use async_std::io::WriteExt;

#[async_std::main]
async fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    let listener = TcpListener::bind("127.0.0.1:7000").await?;
    while let Ok((mut client, addr)) = listener.accept().await {
        client.write_all(b"Hello world\n").await?;
    }

    Ok(())
}
```

You'll see the **async_std::main** above as a macro that simply expands out into a **block_on** function. The **async_std** runtime needs to convert the async function into something that returns a *Future* trait and does so with a simple function that spawns a task with an async block.

```rust
use async_std::net::TcpListener;
use async_std::io::WriteExt;

fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    async fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
        let listener = TcpListener::bind("127.0.0.1:7000").await?;
        while let Ok((mut client, addr)) = listener.accept().await {
            client.write_all(b"Hello world\n").await?;
        }
        Ok(())
    }
    async_std::task::block_on(async { main().await });
}
```

Spawning a task on the executor kicks off the root future to be polled while leaf futures such as [async_std::net::TcpListener](https://docs.rs/async-std/latest/async_std/net/struct.TcpListener.html) will wrap std lib [std::net::TcpListener](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/net/struct.TcpListener.html) within an [Async](https://docs.rs/async-io/latest/async_io) adapter. What's great about the way **async_std** is now implemented is that the underlying async primitives rely on the [smol-rs/async-io](https://github.com/smol-rs/async-io) crate. These provide additional traits through generic **Async<T>** types built for the standard library. This makes it easy to extend any primitive that has I/O handles that can be put into non-blocking mode (via epoll/kqueue..etc) to provide an async interface for it.

> [smol-rs](https://github.com/smol-rs/smol) is also a great lightweight and fast async runtime that I highly recommend as well. The code is split up between composable [executors](https://github.com/smol-rs/async-executor), [async-fs](https://github.com/smol-rs/async-fs), [async-io](https://github.com/smol-rs/async-io), [locking](https://github.com/smol-rs/async-lock), [async-process](https://github.com/smol-rs/async-process), task abstraction via [async-task](https://github.com/smol-rs/async-task), [lightweight futures](https://github.com/smol-rs/futures-lite), [polling](https://github.com/smol-rs/polling) among a few other composable packages that make async primitives and runtimes a breeze to work with over more monolithic packages! It's so good that **async-std** switched [#836](https://github.com/async-rs/async-std/pull/836)

## [pulldown-cmark](https://docs.rs/pulldown-cmark)

In order to actually support transforming markdown (e.g. [CommonMark specification](https://commonmark.org/)) into HTML we will use the **pulldown-cmark** crate. There are numerous cmark/markdown parsers among all the variants, but in particular this crate will use a *pull parsing* approach. This design approach keeps parsing and rendering cleanly separated without the need for error-prone state based callbacks. At its core, the pull parser is an iterator of events and this makes [pulldown-cmark](https://docs.rs/pulldown-cmark) particularly idiomatic rust in implementation. We'll use it below:

```rust
use pulldown_cmark::{html, Parser};

fn main() {
    let markdown_input: &str = "Hello world, this is a *very simple* example.";
    let parser = Parser::new(markdown_input);

    let mut html_output: String = String::new();
    html::push_html(&mut html_output, parser);

    let expected_html = "<p>Hello world, this is a <em>very simple</em> example.</p>\n";
    assert_eq!(expected_html, &html_output);
}
```

## [actix.rs](https://actix.rs) vs [http-rs/tide](https://github.com/http-rs/tide)

In order to build a simple web application we are going to need to pick a web framework. I've chosen [http-rs/tide](https://github.com/http-rs/tide) for now due to some of the limitations and idiomatics of other frameworks. While **tide** only currently supports HTTP/1.x, the main reason I'd like to use this over other frameworks (such as [actix-rs](https://actix.rs)) has much to do with the way the code is implemented and the push for idiomatic async rust. Tide was created by the [rust network service wg](https://rustasync.github.io/team/2018/09/11/tide.html). Part of what I dislike about other frameworks like [actix-rs](https://actix.rs) is the use of the **Service** trait as it adopts some of the behavior that you typically find in places like Servlets in Java. While some of this is mitigated by the use of closures to [make_service_fn](https://docs.rs/hyper/0.13.1/hyper/service/fn.make_service_fn.html), I still prefer an approach that can push towards some kind of simplified and functional async middleware.

While [actix.rs](https://actix.rs/docs/handlers) does provide some nice tooling for simple handlers like many frameworks (including the use of decorators).

```rust
#[get("/")]
async fn index(_req: HttpRequest) -> String {
    "Hello world!".to_owned()
}
```

The implementation of a middleware function can get somewhat confusing pretty quickly due to the use of associated types and Service/Transform models. The advantage, however with this approach is that it can be easier to maintain internal state as a transform/service can do more than be a simple middleware function.

```rust
pub struct SayHiMiddleware<S> {
    service: S,
}

impl<S, B> Service<ServiceRequest> for SayHiMiddleware<S>
where
    S: Service<ServiceRequest, Response = ServiceResponse<B>, Error = Error>,
    S::Future: 'static,
    B: 'static,
{
    type Response = ServiceResponse<B>;
    type Error = Error;
    type Future = LocalBoxFuture<'static, Result<Self::Response, Self::Error>>;

    forward_ready!(service);

    fn call(&self, req: ServiceRequest) -> Self::Future {
        println!("Hi from start. You requested: {}", req.path());

        let fut = self.service.call(req);

        Box::pin(async move {
            let res = fut.await?;

            println!("Hi from response");
            Ok(res)
        })
    }
}
```

There are wrappers to mitigate having to implement a more robust middleware service as in the above case via the [wrap_fn](https://docs.rs/actix-web/4.1.0/actix_web/struct.App.html#method.wrap_fn) but it's more for simple cases. 

```rust
use actix_web::{dev::Service as _, middleware, web, App};
use actix_web::http::header::{CONTENT_TYPE, HeaderValue};

async fn index() -> &'static str {
    "Welcome!"
}

let app = App::new()
    .wrap_fn(|req, srv| {
        let fut = srv.call(req);
        async {
            let mut res = fut.await?;
            res.headers_mut()
                .insert(CONTENT_TYPE, HeaderValue::from_static("text/plain"));
            Ok(res)
        }
    })
    .route("/index.html", web::get().to(index));
```

In general, middleware is treated as a Service and Transform trait model. It also appears that much of this could of been designed prior to improvements to **borrowing within async/await**.

I'll also plainly admit that the bulk of the complexity in many of these libraries isn't necessarily their fault so much as its **rust** fault for not having proper support for **[async in traits](https://rust-lang.github.io/wg-async/vision/roadmap/async_iter/traits.html)**. As **async/await** lands in [traits](https://rust-lang.github.io/wg-async/vision/roadmap/async_iter/traits.html) and more improvements come such as **async iterators** we should see more clean and idiomatic libraries be released.

## [http-rs/tide](https://github.com/http-rs/tide)

The complexity of Services, ServiceFactories, and Transformers adds some generic flexibility that may not be needed for relatively simple projects like ours. Complexity can be great for different requirements, but for our needs it helps with the learning curve to look at much more simplified models like [tide](https://github.com/http-rs/tide) where both the repo code and our app feels **native**. Let's start with a simple app:

```rust
async fn index(req: Request<()>) -> tide::Result {
    let mut res = Response::new(200);
    res.set_body("hello world");
    Ok(res)
}

#[async_std::main]
async fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    let mut app = tide::new();

    // map / to index
    app.at("/static").serve_dir("client/dist")
    app.at("/").get(index);

    // listen and await
    app.listen("127.0.0.1:1234").await?;
    Ok(())
}
```

#### Server

Let's explore what this is doing in further detail. **tide::new()** is simply a function that returns a **Server**.

```rust
pub fn new() -> server::Server<()> {
    Server::new()
}
```

The actual Server implementation contains a few fields, a *Router* which contains a simple *HashMap* between methods to router functions, a *State* object for passing along between requests, and a thread safe **middleware** list for processing requests.

```rust
pub struct Server<State> {
    router: Arc<Router<State>>,
    state: State,
    middleware: Arc<Vec<Arc<dyn Middleware<State>>>>
}
```

#### Routing

The **at("/")** function in the *Server* simply uses the **Router** to return a [Route](https://github.com/http-rs/tide/blob/main/src/route.rs) where the majority of the api functions are. We use the **.get(index)** method here, but there are other methods available ([get](https://docs.rs/tide/latest/tide/struct.Route.html#method.get), [head](https://docs.rs/tide/latest/tide/struct.Route.html#method.head), [put](https://docs.rs/tide/latest/tide/struct.Route.html#method.put), [post](https://docs.rs/tide/latest/tide/struct.Route.html#method.post), [delete](https://docs.rs/tide/latest/tide/struct.Route.html#method.delete), [options](https://docs.rs/tide/latest/tide/struct.Route.html#method.options), [connect](https://docs.rs/tide/latest/tide/struct.Route.html#method.connect), [patch](https://docs.rs/tide/latest/tide/struct.Route.html#method.patch), [trace](https://docs.rs/tide/latest/tide/struct.Route.html#method.trace)). All of which simply push the method, path and middleware endpoint to the router.

```rust
impl<'a, State: Clone + Send + Sync + 'static> Route<'a, State> {
    pub fn method(&mut self, method: http_types::Method, ep: impl Endpoint<State>) -> &mut Self {
        if self.prefix {
            let ep = StripPrefixEndpoint::new(ep);
            let wildcard = self.at("*");
            wildcard.router.add(
                &wildcard.path,
                method,
                MiddlewareEndpoint::wrap_with_middleware(ep, &wildcard.middleware),
            );
        } else {
            self.router.add(
                &self.path,
                method,
                MiddlewareEndpoint::wrap_with_middleware(ep, &self.middleware),
            );
        }
        self
    }
}
```

#### Static Files

Additional methods on the route provide the ability to [serve files](https://docs.rs/tide/latest/tide/struct.Route.html#method.serve_file) and [serve directories](https://docs.rs/tide/latest/tide/struct.Route.html#method.serve_dir). These are simple endpoint middleware implementations that use the [http-types](https://docs.rs/http-types/latest/src/http_types/body.rs.html) **Body::from_file**, which (along with setting content type and length) uses **async_std** [File::open](https://docs.rs/async-std/latest/async_std/fs/struct.File.html#method.open). *async-std::fs* interacts with the filesystem in an asynchronous way by initiating *thread pool tasks* and an *AsyncBufReader* to read the file contents.

```rust
#[async_trait]
impl<State: Clone + Send + Sync + 'static> Endpoint<State> for ServeFile {
    async fn call(&self, _: Request<State>) -> Result {
        match Body::from_file(&self.path).await {
            Ok(body) => Ok(Response::builder(StatusCode::Ok).body(body).build()),
            Err(e) if e.kind() == io::ErrorKind::NotFound => {
                log::warn!("File not found: {:?}", &self.path);
                Ok(Response::new(StatusCode::NotFound))
            }
            Err(e) => Err(e.into()),
        }
    }
}
```

#### Listener

The last line of code in the sample makes a call to `app.listen("127.0.0.1:1234").await`. This particular function makes use of an *Into* pattern to convert varying types to convert into a Listener.

```rust
impl<State> ToListener<State> for String
where
    State: Clone + Send + Sync + 'static,
{
    type Listener = ParsedListener<State>;
    fn to_listener(self) -> io::Result<Self::Listener> {
        ToListener::<State>::to_listener(self.as_str())
    }
}

impl<State> ToListener<State> for (String, u16)
where
    State: Clone + Send + Sync + 'static,
{
    type Listener = TcpListener<State>;
    fn to_listener(self) -> io::Result<Self::Listener> {
        ToListener::<State>::to_listener((self.0.as_str(), self.1))
    }
}

impl<State> ToListener<State> for async_std::net::TcpListener
where
    State: Clone + Send + Sync + 'static,
{
    type Listener = TcpListener<State>;
    fn to_listener(self) -> io::Result<Self::Listener> {
        Ok(TcpListener::from_listener(self))
    }
}
```

#### Bind/Accept Loop

As soon as the listener is parsed and converted into either **TcpListener** or **UnixListener**, *bind* and *accept* will be called. Where *bind* will await the underlying `async_std::net::TcpListener` bind, whereas *accept* begins an incoming accept loop.

```rust
let mut incoming = listener.incoming();

while let Some(stream) = incoming.next().await {
    match stream {
        Err(ref e) if is_transient_error(e) => continue,
        Err(error) => {
            let delay = std::time::Duration::from_millis(500);
            crate::log::error!("Error: {}. Pausing for {:?}.", error, delay);
            task::sleep(delay).await;
            continue;
        }

        Ok(stream) => {
            handle_tcp(server.clone(), stream);
        }
    };
}
```

#### task::spawn

The last part of the accept loop needs to spawn a new task for each client, read from the socket, parse into a request and execute the response middleware. This task::spawn is making use of **async_std** to push a new future task onto the runtime to be polled.

```rust
fn handle_tcp<State: Clone + Send + Sync + 'static>(app: Server<State>, stream: TcpStream) {
    task::spawn(async move {
        let local_addr = stream.local_addr().ok();
        let peer_addr = stream.peer_addr().ok();

        let fut = async_h1::accept(stream, |mut req| async {
            req.set_local_addr(local_addr);
            req.set_peer_addr(peer_addr);
            app.respond(req).await
        });

        if let Err(error) = fut.await {
            log::error!("async-h1 error", { error: error.to_string() });
        }
    });
}
```

### [async_h1](https://github.com/http-rs/async-h1/blob/main/src/server/encode.rs) and [http-types](https://docs.rs/http-types)

To provide support for HTTP/1.x *tide* makes use of the **async-h1** crate and encapsulates with it the **http-types** type system. This elegant separation of minimal single-purpose crates keeps **tide** straightforward to implement our own system by putting these concepts together. For **async_h1**, the main pattern here is implementing HTTP as a codec with an async encoder/decoder pattern. We can see this on the **Request** side of the decoder.

```rust
use async_std::io::{BufReader, Read, Write};

pub async fn decode<IO>(mut io: IO) -> http_types::Result<Option<(Request, BodyReader<IO>)>>
where
    IO: Read + Write + Clone + Send + Sync + Unpin + 'static,
{
    let mut reader = BufReader::new(io.clone());
    let mut buf = Vec::new();
    let mut headers = [httparse::EMPTY_HEADER; MAX_HEADERS];
    let mut httparse_req = httparse::Request::new(&mut headers);

    // Keep reading bytes from the stream until we hit the end of the stream.
    loop {
        let bytes_read = reader.read_until(LF, &mut buf).await?;
```

The main portions the [decode](https://github.com/http-rs/async-h1/blob/main/src/server/decode.rs) function here is an async function that uses the **async_std** *BufReader* to read from the underlying client. The use of [httpparse](https://docs.rs/httpparse) here is to simply get the underlying bytes into a more readable state (*&str*) before it is ultimately decoded into an **http-types** *Request* object.

On the other end of this we have the [Response](https://docs.rs/http-types/latest/http_types/struct.Response.html) *http-types* where **async-h1** can encode via the async encoder. This is especially useful to allow the for things like **Chunked** encoding.

```rust
impl Read for Encoder {
    fn poll_read(
        mut self: Pin<&mut Self>,
        cx: &mut Context<'_>,
        buf: &mut [u8],
    ) -> Poll<io::Result<usize>> {
        loop {
            self.state = match self.state {
                EncoderState::Start => EncoderState::Head(self.compute_head()?),

                EncoderState::Head(ref mut cursor) => {
                    read_to_end!(Pin::new(cursor).poll_read(cx, buf));

                    if self.method == Method::Head {
                        EncoderState::End
                    } else {
                        EncoderState::Body(BodyEncoder::new(self.response.take_body()))
                    }
                }

                EncoderState::Body(ref mut encoder) => {
                    read_to_end!(Pin::new(encoder).poll_read(cx, buf));
                    EncoderState::End
                }

                EncoderState::End => return Poll::Ready(Ok(0)),
            }
        }
    }
}
```

You can see in the above implementation of the encoder on each time the future is polled (AyncRead) the encoder uses a state machine to either compute and read headers, read the body contents through the **BodyEncoder** and finally return Ready when the state is completed. It's an elegant use of a minimal state machine and I highly recommend browsing any of these dependencies to get a feel for how you might implement something similar.

## Implementing a Blog

Now that we've got the fundamental dependencies covered, let's go ahead and actually make use of them with [tide](https://github.com/http-rs/tide). I highly recommend browsing the above dependencies in detail as it gives a look at how to implement your own runtime, separate concerns, building a protocol layer, and making use of async I/O with single-purpose packages. These are great codebases to learn from and they do well to at aiming towards good ergonomics and idiomatics. I imagine more libraries will get similarly clean as new features are introduced in the rust language with support for things like [async traits](https://rust-lang.github.io/wg-async/vision/roadmap/async_iter/traits.html) and even [portable/interopable runtimes](https://rust-lang.github.io/wg-async/vision/roadmap/portable/runtime.html).

### Setup

As before, we will use the dependencies listed at the beginning of this post. Here it is once more:

```toml
[package]
name = "notes"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[dependencies]
async-std = { version = "1.12.0", features = ["attributes"] }
handlebars = "4.3.1"
pulldown-cmark = "0.9.1"
serde = { version = "1.0.137", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "1.0.81"
tide = "0.16.0"
```

Our main function will setup a few modules we will expand on and import to run the **tide** app.

```rust
mod registry;
mod routes;
mod errors;

use tide::utils::After;

#[async_std::main]
async fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    let mut app = tide::new();
    // serve static files
    app.at("/static").serve_dir("client/dist")?;

    app.with(After(errors::error_handler));
    routes::configure(&mut app);

    // listen and await
    app.listen("127.0.0.1:1234").await?;
    Ok(())
}
```

The use of [tide::utils::After](https://docs.rs/tide/latest/tide/utils/struct.After.html) is a middleware that operates on outgoing responses. This is useful for us as we want to be able to have a catch-all for errors and write the appropriate response for them.

### Template Registry

In order to support simple templates that output markdown html we will use the [handlebars](https://docs.rs/handlebars) crate to get the job done. Within the `registry.rs` file as specified in the `mod registry` declaration add the following:

```rust
use handlebars::Handlebars;

#[derive(Clone)]
pub struct State {
    registry: Handlebars<'static>,
}

impl State {
    pub fn default() -> Self {
        let mut state = State {
            registry: Handlebars::new(),
        };
        state.registry.set_dev_mode(true);
        state.template("index.html", "client/dist/index.html");
        state.template("posts.html", "client/dist/posts.html");
        state
    }

    pub fn template(&mut self, name: &str, path: &str) {
        self.registry.register_template_file(name, path).unwrap();
    }
}
```

> [handlebars::Handlebars::set_dev_mode](https://docs.rs/handlebars/latest/handlebars/struct.Handlebars.html#method.set_dev_mode) is a useful mode to allow us to ensure that changes made to the template will be loaded on every request rather than cached.

The [handlebars::Handlebars::register_template_file](https://docs.rs/handlebars/latest/handlebars/struct.Handlebars.html#method.register_template_file) here is simply registering a key to a file source based on the passed in path and name. This is later used below with a call to [render](https://docs.rs/handlebars/latest/handlebars/struct.Handlebars.html#method.render) where the compiled [handlebars::template::Template](https://docs.rs/handlebars/latest/handlebars/template/struct.Template.html) is evaluated with the provided serializable context.

In order to render responses to [http-types::Response](https://docs.rs/http-types/latest/http_types/struct.Response.html) that can then be encoded by [async-h1](https://docs.rs/async-h1) let's create a few utility methods.

```rust
use serde::Serialize;
use tide::{Body, Response};

impl State {
    pub fn default() -> Self { ... }
    pub fn template(&mut self, name: &str, path: &str) { ... }

    pub fn render<T: Serialize>(&self, name: &str, data: &T) -> tide::Result<Response> {
        let mut response = Response::new(200);
        self.render_body(&mut response, name, data);
        Ok(response)
    }

    pub fn render_body<T: Serialize>(&self, response: &mut Response, name: &str, data: &T) {
        let body = self.registry.render(name, data).unwrap();
        let mut body = Body::from_string(body);
        body.set_mime("text/html");
        response.set_body(body);
    }
}
```

Following the use of the [handlebars::Handlebars::render](https://docs.rs/handlebars/latest/handlebars/struct.Handlebars.html#method.render), we also construct an [http-types::Body](https://docs.rs/http-types/latest/http_types/struct.Body.html) from the rendered content and set the mime type header before returning the [http-types:Response](https://docs.rs/http-types/latest/http_types/struct.Response.html). Finally, we are going to make use of a [thread static local](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/macro.thread_local.html) state to encapsulate the template registry (rather than use the **tide::State** as part of the [Request](https://docs.rs/tide/latest/tide/struct.Request.html#method.state). The main reason for this is that I wanted to be able to use this static template registry in the error handling middleware as well without having any effect on the request pipeline. There are other ways we could do this but for now I wanted to keep template registry as a pre-built static registry. Simply add the following to the `registry.rs` file below:

```rust
thread_local! {
    pub static REGISTRY: State = State::default();
}
```

### Routes

In order to handle a few handlers for the blog we simply need to register the route we are interested in such as `posts/:year/:month/:day/:title` to capture each of the variables in the request parameters. We will make quick use of [pulldown-cmark](https://docs.rs/pulldown_cmark) to transform a loaded [async_std::fs::File](https://docs.rs/async-std/latest/async_std/fs/struct.File.html) into HTML output through the [pulldown_cmark::Parser](https://docs.rs/pulldown-cmark/latest/pulldown_cmark/struct.Parser.html)

```rust
use async_std::{fs::File, io::ReadExt};
use serde_json::json;

use crate::registry::REGISTRY;

pub fn configure(app: &mut tide::Server<()>) {
    app.at("/posts/:year/:month/:day/:id").get(get_post);
}

async fn get_post(req: tide::Request<()>) -> tide::Result<tide::Response> {
    // open up file based on request (fallback to not found)
    let url = format!(
        "posts/{}/{}/{}/{}.md",
        req.param("year")?,
        req.param("month")?,
        req.param("day")?,
        req.param("id")?
    );
    // open markdown file and read to string
    let mut md_file = File::open(url).await?;
    let mut buf = String::new();
    md_file.read_to_string(&mut buf).await?;

    // convert markdown file to html
    let parser = pulldown_cmark::Parser::new(&buf);
    let mut html_content = String::new();
    pulldown_cmark::html::push_html(&mut html_content, parser);

    // render template with content
    REGISTRY.with(|c| c.render("index.html", &json!({ "content": html_content })))
}
```

Finally, a call to the *REGISTRY* to **render** the provided template and pass along some [json!](https://docs.rs/serde_json/latest/serde_json/macro.json.html) data thanks to [serde-json](https://docs.rs/serde_json).

### Error Handling

As a fallback for when we encounter errors (such as when a file is not found or we receive an invalid request) we declare the use of `After(errors::error_handler)`. Go ahead and add the following to `errors.rs`.

```rust
use std::io::ErrorKind;
use serde_json::json;

use crate::registry::REGISTRY;

async fn error_handler(mut res: tide::Response) -> tide::Result<Response> {
    if let Some(err) = res.downcast_error::<async_std::io::Error>() {
        if let ErrorKind::NotFound = err.kind() {
            res.set_status(StatusCode::NotFound);
        }
    }
    if res.status() == StatusCode::NotFound {
        REGISTRY.with(|c| {
            c.render_body(&mut res, "index.html", &json!({ "content": "Not found" }));
        });
    }
    Ok(res)
}
```

Here we are making use of [std::io::ErrorKind](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/io/enum.ErrorKind.html) to determine if the error happens to be a downcast from an *async-std::io::Error* and happens to be a **NotFound** error kind. We use this to set the appropriate [set_status](https://docs.rs/tide/latest/tide/struct.Response.html#method.set_status) on the response. Finally, assuming the status code is **NotFound** we will simply render out the standard **index.html** template with some *Not Found* content.


### Tailwind + Parcel + Highlight.js

Now that the backend is completed in Rust, we can move along to the HTML templates. I've chosen to use [parcel](https://parceljs.org/) as the build tool, [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) as the CSS framework, and [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) for code syntax highlighting. We've already implemented the markdown to HTML part of the application, we simply need a way to render it in HTML/CSS. In a new directory `client` run the following.

```bash
mkdir client
touch client/package.json
```

#### Dependencies

Edit `package.json` and add the following, followed by running `npm install` to ensure the dependencies are properly setup.

```json
{
  "name": "notes",
  "source": "src/index.html",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "parcel",
    "build": "parcel build"
  },
  "targets": {
      "default": {
          "publicUrl": "/static"
      }
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@tailwindcss/typography": "^0.5.2",
    "parcel": "latest",
    "postcss": "^8.4.14",
    "tailwindcss": "^3.1.4"
  }
}
```

#### Index Template / Tailwind CSS

Now that we have the dependencies in order and a few scripts we can setup the `client/src/index.html` and `client/src/index.css` appropriately.

```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Hello World</title>
    <link href="./index.css" rel="stylesheet">

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

@layer base {
    .prose pre {
        padding: 0px;
        background: none;
        @apply border-t-2 border-t-gray-50 rounded-md block shadow-md;
    }
}
```

These files make use of a number of tailwind utilities but don't be particularly intimidated by them. A lot of that is just padding, the use of [tailwind/typography](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/typography-plugin) and various flexbox and color values. I've also added a few social svg icons in the footer and styles for the font to make it a bit easier on the eye. The bulk of the work is being done by [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org) to perform the actual syntax highlighting by the code. 

Also make note of the `content` in the template. This is a **raw html** declaration that simply passes along the variable *content* as we declared in the rust backend code. Handlebars will make sure to parse this and render that content appropriately.

#### Tailwind Configuration

In order for tailwind to take effect, you'll also need a `tailwind.config.js` configuration file so that **parcel** can actually build the content. You'll also need a simple `.postcssrc` for postcss to work in combination with tailwind.

```js
module.exports = {
    content: [
        "./src/**/*.{html,css,js,jsx,ts,tsx}"
    ],
    theme: {
        container: {
            center: true
        },
        extend: {}
    },
    plugins: [
        require("@tailwindcss/typography")
    ],
}
```

```
{
    "plugins": {
        "tailwindcss": {}
    }
}
```

## Success!

All that's left is building with `npm run build` or `parcel build` in the `client` directory, followed by running the rust backend with `cargo run`.

```bash
# building the client
~/rust-tutorials/notes/client
nyxtom@enceladus$ parcel build src/*
✨ Built in 1.49s

If you go ahead and create a sample markdown file in `posts/2022/06/25/tide.md` for instance you should be able to open up the the browser to `localhost:1234/posts/2022/06/25/tide` and see your post!

## Conclusion

Thanks for joining me on this tutorial / journey. This tutorial was mainly designed to give an introduction to framework crates that are out there in Rust and what you can put together yourself if you look for the right idiomatic packages. There are a lot of resources out there for learning but sometimes it helps to just look at the source code of these packages and see how the internals are put together. I've found that I've learned a significant amount just by doing that and if something is a bit too complex I try and find packages that simplify the mental model. [smol-rs](https://github.com/smol-rs/smol) and [tide](https://docs.rs/tide) are great examples of building single-purpose dependencies as opposed to monolithic structures. These kind of packages are great for learning Rust!
